CSCI 4229 (Computer Graphics)
Fall 2016
University of Colorado Boulder
Final Project

---Description---
An OpenGL project that embodies eveything taught in CSCI 4229.
Contains Lighting, Transparency, Fog, Textures, Skybox, Object Loading and other elements taught.

FINAL PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
All animated portions of the assignment are complete.
The bird's materials are properly transported into openGL,using two differnt obj files switching in and out to 
animate bird flapping.

For the day and night cycles, this was accomplish through a multitude of tricks. The skybox is slightly transparent 
and has a function cycling the cube background colors from black to white while dimming fog intensity and ambient light. 
After a while the program swaps between two sky textures during high fog and peak lighting states and changes light position.

Rain: Each transparent vertex particle is set with a stardard life value, a random decaying value, random positions and
simply translates movement downward until the life value is less than zero. Then the function checks to reset the life/pos
Hail: To mimic the bouncing of hail, there is an added condition to inverse the velocity value once the hail reaches 
a certain y value (the floor). Hail is also faster then rain and whiter blue. It's still transparent, but now cube shaped.
Snow: A slower rain function with slow and ball shaped properties. It now changes the floor vertices (SHAPE) and color through 
an initially invisible field under the floor. The particle field also has normals to better reflect light to the new snow shape.

I added normals onto each particle of rain, hail and snow. Transparency was also added to better reflect liquid and lighting, 
with modifications on floor contact behavior. Properties in the functions were changed to better reflect realistic weather within
the scene, with more particles, larger area and more randomness compared to its source, since the source was rather similar 
to a simple rain function with little variation. Hail now Bounces as compared to the source and Normals are on the snowy 
ground vertices, snow now accumalates further and reshapes the ground.

Object models were modified to work with the object.c file importer, with bitmaps and normals redone correctly via Blender to 
match the scene's lighting (Mostly the tree).

THE PROGRAM TAKES 80 SECONDS TO CYCLE THROUGH 1 FULL DAY, NIGHT AND RANDOM WEATHER CYCLE.
