CSCI 4229 (Computer Graphics)
Fall 2016
University of Colorado Boulder
Homework 4

ESTIMATED TIME SPENT: 4 hours and 00 minutes
ESTIMATED REDO TIME:  2 hours and 00 minutes
TOTAL TIME:           6 Hours

NOTE: I Changed some of the drawn pieces in the scene and the amount of edges to confirm working normals.
When I pass lower amount of required edges, the torus would use less vertex surface draws and have less normals per surface, like a cube.
This means the torus would draw normals in the same direction multiple times if there are less edges passed.
Sorry for the horrible normal vectors, I assumed since torus are circular, they can have normals like spheres.
