Homework 6

ESTIMATED TIME SPENT: 5 hours and 00 minutes

NOTES: Mapping Textures to a torus is harder than I imagined... I have to figure out how to map which parts of the image to the creation
Eventually, I found a way to may the texture based on ever iteration, wrapping around the circles the loop was making for the torus
